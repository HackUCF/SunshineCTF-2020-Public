# [Forensics 400] Family Nas Backup

This challenge is essentially a real forensics task, given a clustered ceph cluster recover files from it, easy enough(no ceph is really annoying)?
in ceph there is a file call testfile.bmp which is a video file that is one second containing the flag as a block of text in a pptx video.
